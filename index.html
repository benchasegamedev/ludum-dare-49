<h1>Population Balance</h1>
<p>Welcome to Population Balance!</p>

<p>Population Balance is a game created for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam hosted between October 
1 and October 4, 2021. The theme for this jam is "unstable".</p>

<p>In the game, players try to balance a town's unstable population through the elections of 
new mayors. Some mayors may bring a lot of people in, but some may drive a lot of people 
out.</p>

<p>There's really not much else to the game.</p>
