# Population Balance
Welcome to Population Balance!

Population Balance is a game created for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam hosted between October 1 and October 4, 2021. The theme for this jam is "unstable".

In the game, players try to balance a town's unstable population through the elections of new mayors. Some mayors may bring a lot of people in, but some may drive a lot of people out.

There's really not much else to the game.
